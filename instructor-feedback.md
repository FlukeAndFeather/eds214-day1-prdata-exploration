#### Exceeds Spec

Code is appropriately commented: I believe that my headers and in-line code make the code understandable to someone who may have never seen code before. I do fear that I have over-commented, but I'm still trying to figure out where to land on that.

The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works: I believe that my README is very thorough, and could be useful to someone who is completely unfamiliar with R. I am probably being too verbose, but would love some advice on how I can make the explanation of my analysis more professional.

#### Collaboration

My participation in peer feedback was a bit bumpy because I initially reviewed the project for the wrong student, but I was able to go back and give Marie feedback on all of her specs. I found it was very valuable to see what the process was like for a borderline finished project and for a project that needed a fair amount of work to do. I believe I was able to help Marie understand how to utilize separate scripts for data import and cleaning, and then source those in the quarto document. Megan also directly helped me fix my rolling average function to eliminate NA values.
